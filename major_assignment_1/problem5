while working on karel, I had a bunch of errors from reading about how different things worked, and then stopping before I actually found out everything they needed to function. Specifically:
pseudocode: I tried to start writing Karel without any and (thankfully very quickly) realized that I was making a bad choice. I did some planning and it was smooth sailing from there.
switches: first I didn't see where it said thy had to be ints, and then I didn't realize that the break; statements were crutial.
classes: I didn't read far enough to find out how to format class functions. At this point, I think what I had would have worked, but the final version is much cleaner.

not karel:
floats: apparently floats are weird. I was having a lot of problems until I found out that in float math, 1.02 - 1.01 = 0.00999999. This is obviously a problem if you're rounding down.
                The answer to this one is to avoid doing math with floating point numbers as much as possible.
